            Win‑Win Apps ("Win‑Win Apps," "we," "us," and "our") provides Shopify applications that help merchants
            improve customer experience and grow their business. This Privacy Policy is designed to help you understand how
            we collect, use, and share your personal information and to help you understand and exercise your privacy
            rights.
          </p>

          <h2>Scope</h2>
          <p>
            This Privacy Policy applies to personal information processed by us, including on our websites, Shopify
            applications, and other online or offline offerings. To make this Privacy Policy easier to read, our websites
            and other offerings are collectively called "Services".
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>An Important Note:</strong> This Privacy Policy does not apply to any of the personal information
            that our Merchants may process about their end customers using Win‑Win Apps products and services ("Merchant
            Data"). Our Merchants' respective privacy policies govern the collection and use of Merchant Data. Our
            processing of Merchant Data is governed by the contracts that we have in place with our Merchants, not this
            Privacy Policy. Any questions or requests relating to Merchant Data should be directed to our Merchants.
          </p>

          <h2>Personal Information We Collect</h2>

              email address, and Shopify store information.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Contact Information:</strong> If you contact us through our website or support channels, we will

          <h3>Automated Technologies</h3>
          <p>
            "Site Information" means information received and recorded on our server logs from your browser, including
            your IP address, browser type, the date and time of the use, the pages you visit, the page you came from and
            go to when leaving the Win‑Win Apps Service, your operating system and information about your mobile device.
            We may combine this automatically collected log information with other information we collect about you.
          </p>
          <p>
            We (and our vendors) collect that information using cookies, pixel tags, web beacons, embedded web links, and
            similar technologies. Users can control the use of cookies at the individual browser level. If you reject
            cookies, you may still use our site, but your ability to use some features or areas of our service may be
            limited.
          </p>
          <p>
            We and our partners use technologies such as cookies or similar technologies to analyze trends, administer the
            website, track users' movements around the website, and gather demographic information about our user base as
            a whole. We also use cookies for our shopping cart, to remember users' settings (e.g. language preference),
            for authentication and for other similar services.
          </p>

          <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>

          </p>
          <p>
            We partner with a third party to either display advertising on our website or to manage our advertising on
            other sites. Our third-party partner may use technologies such as cookies to gather information about your
            activities on this website and other sites in order to provide you with advertising based on your browsing
            activities and interests.
          </p>

          <p>
            We will share the information we collect, including your Personal Information, as needed to provide the
            Win‑Win Apps Service to you. We will also share your Personal Information with your permission. Otherwise, we

            To provide you with the Win‑Win Apps Service, we share information, including Personal Information, with
            third-party vendors and service providers. For example, we provide Personal Information to companies that help
            us with our business activities, such as marketing and payment processing. We will use reasonable efforts to
            ensure those companies use your Personal Information only as necessary.
          </p>

          <h3>As Required by Law and Similar Disclosures</h3>
          <p>
            In certain situations, Win‑Win Apps may be required to disclose personal data in response to lawful requests
            by public authorities, including meeting law enforcement requirements. We may access, preserve, and disclose
            your Personal Information and content if we believe doing so is required or appropriate to comply with law
            enforcement requests, such as a court order or subpoena, bankruptcy proceedings, or similar legal process or
            when we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights or the rights of others.
          </p>

          <h3>Merger, Sale or Other Asset Transfers</h3>
          <p>
            If Win‑Win Apps is involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, you will be
            notified via email and/or a prominent notice on our website, of any change in ownership, uses of your personal
            information, and choices you may have regarding your personal information. We may also disclose your personal
            information to any other third party with your prior consent.
          </p>

          <h2>Your Privacy Choices And Rights</h2>
          <p>
            Upon request Win‑Win Apps will provide you with information about whether we hold any of your personal
            information. If you would like to update or modify any Personal Information you have provided to us, you can
            do so in the account settings tab of your dashboard or by contacting us. For your protection, we will require
            some proof of your identity to obtain any Personal Information hosted on our site. Additionally, you may
            deactivate your account by contacting us. At your request, we will remove your Personal Information, provided
            we have no outstanding business or other obligation requiring such information. We will respond to your request
            within a reasonable timeframe.
          </p>

          <h3>Children's Privacy</h3>
          <p>
            We do not knowingly collect, maintain, or use Personal Information from children under 13 years of age without

            learn that your child has provided us with Personal Information without your consent, you may alert us at
            <a href="mailto:omar@wwapps.io">omar@wwapps.io</a>.
          </p>

          <h3>Data Retention</h3>
          <p>
            We will retain your information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you with

          <p>
            We take steps to ensure that your information is treated securely and in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
            Unfortunately, no system is 100% secure, and we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you
            provide to us. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, we do not accept liability for unauthorized
            disclosure.
          </p>
